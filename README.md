Hey, I'm @nstein5
I am proficient with python, but have used c#, c++, java, html, and css before.
I am currently studying to be a penetration tester in the future.
I currently have my ITF+, A+, Network+, and Security+.
In the future I will be getting my Ceh, Cysa+, and possibly my linux+.
I will happily work on any python based program, especially if it is cybersecurity related.
I can be reached at nstein68@gmail.com
