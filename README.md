Hey, I'm @nstein5.
I am proficient with python, bash, and powershell, but have used c#, c++, java, html, and css before.
I'm studying to be a penetration tester. This is done through certifications, CTFs, and watching (and someday speaking) in conferences.
I currently have my Security+, Network+, PCEP, BTLO, and ~14 others.
In the future I will be getting my Pentest+, eJPT or PNPT, and then my OSCP.
Look out for a CVE published by me, expect it.
